# Gradient-Descent
Applying Gradient descent to a function using projection method and log barrier method. 

Applying gradient descent to f(x,y) = 2x^2+3y^2-xy constrained to the box 1 <= x,y <= 2. Implementation using projection method and log barrier method (with Armijo condition and backtracking line search). 

#Doing the Newton's interpolation for f(x) = ln(1+x) at x0 = 1 using 14 Chebyshev nodes in the interval [0,e-1].
